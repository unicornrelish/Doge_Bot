# Doge_Bot
A comprehensive Discord bot for my personal server(Dogenet, Inc.)

Current version: 0.1.0

***New this version: !stats command displays some server statistics

Eventually I'd like to code the bot to play music in a Discord channel.

It currently has a language filter to block certain words, and commands that print the Minecraft server's IP address.
